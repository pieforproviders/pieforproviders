# Attendance of a child during a specific cycle for a child case
#
# from GitHub comments on the PR to implement this model (PR 320)
# 2020-09-08: open question from Kate D.:
#   When someone adds an attendance, are we expecting them to choose what
#   length of care it is, or are we calculating that by the number of hours
#   as laid out in their subsidy rule?
#   If we're calculating it, can the user change it, if for some reason our
#   calculation gets it wrong?
#
#   2020-09-08: Answer from Chelsea S:
#   Since we haven't designed these screens yet, I don't think we have clear
#   answers. My assumption, though, is that we're calculating it for them based
#   on the number of hours, as laid out in their subsidy rule.
#   I'm not sure if we'll let them change it.
