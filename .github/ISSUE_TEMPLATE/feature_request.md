> 
> Please ensure that you are running Google Lighthouse and/or WebAIM (Wave) on any UI elements in your pull request to check for accessibility issues.
> 
> If it is out of scope to address those accessibility issues in your pull request (because the issue is in a parent component and needs refactoring to work, for example), **you are responsible for noting those issues in your pull request and writing bug tickets to address the issues - make sure you link the new tickets in your pull request**
