The Pie for Providers API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs; accepts form-encoded request bodies; returns JSON-encoded responses; and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the Pie For Providers API in development mode, which does not affect your live data or interact with any production environment
