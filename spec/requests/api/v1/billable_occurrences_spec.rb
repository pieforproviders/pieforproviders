  # we're not testing that the record can be updated directly; the only information this
  # model holds is its billable type and id, and child_approval id - if we change the
  # billable type, we'll need to change the billable attributes, and that's a lot of work
  # to maintain basically a stateless record that can just be recreated for the new type.
  # None of these records should be edited directly.
