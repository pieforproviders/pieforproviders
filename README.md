We help child care providers and families claim the government funding for which they are already eligible.

## Code of Conduct

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with this project.

## Why You Should Contribute

We have a vision for equity and justice in the early childhood field. We know that technology is part of the solution - and that todayâ€™s products do not meet the needs of most communities. Weâ€™re building the market for early childhood technology that educators, families and children deserve.

We need your help!

Pie for Providers helps small child care providers and families claim the government funding for which they are already eligible. Today, 85% of eligible children do not claim this funding. This means families struggle to afford care. This means mothers cannot advance their careers and support their families. This means child care providers - small, women-owned businesses - do not get paid for their work.

Letâ€™s change that. [Contribute to Pie for Providers today](CONTRIBUTING.md) by picking up any of our [open issues](https://bit.ly/PieIssues).

  <summary>Setup and configuration</summary>

---

- clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:pieforproviders/pieforproviders.git`
- navigate to the app directory: `cd pieforproviders`
- install bundler for gems: `gem install bundler`
- install gems: `bundle install`
- set up an environment file: copy `.env.sample` to `.env`
- configure Devise: run `rails secret` to generate a secret string, add it to `.env` as the `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY` value
- create and seed the database: `bundle exec rails db:setup`

<details>
  <summary>Running the app locally</summary>

---
You have several convenient options for running the app locally.

### 1. Rake task (requires `heroku cli`)

- `rails start`
- This spins up both the front end and the back end in the same terminal window

### 2. Foreman (requires `foreman`)

- Run `foreman start`
- This spins up both the front end and the back end in the same terminal windo

### 3. Without Foreman or Heroku

- Start rails in one terminal: `rails s -p 3001`
- Open a second terminal and start react: `cd client && yarn start`

Visit `localhost:3000` to see the React frontend. ðŸ¥³

Visit `localhost:3001/api-docs` to see Swagger UI for API endpoints ðŸ“‘  
  
> ***NOTE:*** Swagger UI is currently not configured to use authentication, so any authenticated endpoints will not be accessible at this route, you'll get unauthorized errors.

  <summary>Using the application</summary>

---

You can create a new user account by visiting `/signup` (or clicking "Sign Up" on the login page at the root).

When you create a new account, you should see a demo email pop up in a new tab; **the link in this URL can't be clicked in local development**.  Instead, copy the path (starting with `localhost`) and paste it into a browser window.  This will confirm your user and automatically log you in.

<details>
  <summary>Running tests</summary>

---

### API

- `bundle exec rspec` or `bundle exec guard` to watch
- When tests pass and you're ready for a PR, please run `rails rswag` to update the API documentation

### Frontend

- `yarn test` (auto-watch) or `yarn test-once` to run the suite one time only

### End to End

- `yarn run cy:ci` from the root directory

### Interactive End to End

- `yarn start-server` in one terminal (make sure rails is not currently running)
- `yarn run cy:open` in another terminal

  <summary>Troubleshooting and FAQs</summary>

---

### Login Issues

**Q: I keep getting redirected to the login screen when after I've created and confirmed my account**  
**A:** Make sure you've created a secret for `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY` in `.env` using `rails secret`

### Postgres

**Q: I get postgres errors when I try to set up the database**  
**A:** Make sure Postgres is running on port 5432. Sometimes Postgres doesn't play nice depending on how you've installed it.  If you're having trouble with Postgres, I strongly recommend `Postgres.app` - you can install multiple versions and it plays nicer with rails.  

### XCode

**Q: I see the following error in my terminal: `gyp: No Xcode or CLT version detected!`**  
**A:** try removing and reinstalling XCode command line tools OR running `xcode-select --reset` (see [this github issue](https://github.com/schnerd/d3-scale-cluster/issues/7) for more info)
